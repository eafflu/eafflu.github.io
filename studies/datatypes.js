/*
 * Datatypes:
 *
 * 0. Datatypes are separated into two categories. Simple/Primitive and Complex
 *
 * 1. Simple/Primitive Datatypes are called so due to the fact that they are immutable. Since they do not have the ability to collect/contain 
 * other values, operations between two simple datatypes will return new values, this operation will not alter the original value.
 *
 * 2. Copy by value vs Copy by reference
 * 
 * 1a. Number
 * 1b. String
 * 1c. Boolean
 * 1d. NAN
 * 1e. undefined
 * 1f. null
 * 1g. Infinity & -infinity
 *
 * 2. Complex Data Types
 * 2a. Function
 * 2b. Array
 * 2c. Object
